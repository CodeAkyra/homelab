# Homelab

This repository contains documentation, configuration files, and hands-on projects from my personal homelab.

It focuses on **network automation and network engineering**, with projects built using:
- Python
- Flask (API-based automation)
- RESTCONF
- Netmiko
- Cisco IOS-XE devices (CSR1000V)
- FortiGate VM
- VMware (ESXi / Workstation) for virtualized lab environments

The goal of this homelab is to:
- Automate repetitive network tasks
- Explore API-driven and programmatic network management
- Design and operate virtualized network lab environments
- Practice real-world network engineering and DevNet concepts

This repository serves as both a **learning lab** and a **portfolio of network automation and virtualization projects**.
